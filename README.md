# Deep Learning CS4240 Reproducibility Project
In this reproducibility project, a simplified version of the method in the paper on 
Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Learning Consistency under Transformations (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32226-7_90)
is implemented and tested on the CIFAR-10 benchmark dataset. 

Python notebook for running the entire simplified method:
DL_RP21_SSCL.ipynb
